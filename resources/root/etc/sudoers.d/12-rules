## The common way to define sudo permissions is a dumb rule like this:
##
##   $USER ALL=(ALL) ALL
##
## Or this:
##
##   %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
##
## Or this:
##
##   %sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL
##
## Well, you've got the idea. That's not good enough. In that case any
## slightly-privileged user will get all the root power, including e.g.
## ability to destroy the whole system just with "sudo rm -rf /".
##
## Even if root account is completely disabled (like in Ubuntu),
## non-root user still be able to run "sudo su", "sudo -s" or similar
## and become a real root.
##
## Indeed, sudo is powerful tool, but great power always comes with
## great responsibility.
##
## Better to try the way below: it allows user to perform only specific
## and not really harmful operations (for common home system).

Cmnd_Alias  ODG_POWER = \
  /usr/bin/halt,        \
  /usr/bin/poweroff,    \
  /usr/bin/reboot,      \
  /usr/bin/shutdown,    \
  /usr/bin/zzz,         \
  /usr/bin/ZZZ

Cmnd_Alias  ODG_OTHER = \
  /usr/bin/dicap,       \
  /usr/bin/hdq

%odg ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ODG_POWER, ODG_OTHER

## Please note: one have to declare the commands with full paths to
## increase security (paths may be gathered by "which" command, for
## instance:
##
##   $ which poweroff
##   /usr/bin/poweroff
##

# xinitrc - classic way to start X.org, window manager and related stuff
#
# By default it should be placed in ~/.xinitrc, but you can override
# this path by modifying startx shell script (it's usually located at
# /bin/startx). Don't modify default version from /bin - copy it into
# /usr/local/bin and edit there instead.
#
# On Void you should run ConsoleKit2 before any other user applications,
# even window manager. If your WM does not provide trivial way to define
# autostart applications (such as composition managers or status bars),
# then you can e.g. run wrapper script in "--exit-with-session" option
# which will start WM along with autostart applications.

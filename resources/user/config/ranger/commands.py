"""
These two commands are based on old ArchWiki snippets from

    <wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ranger#Archives>

which is likely comes from <github.com/ranger/ranger/issues/295> (post
by someone named arkhan)

So-called "atool" works very bad on Void Linux (and it's not maintainded
since 2012), so I replaced it by "7z". Despite the name, 7z is able to
compress to multiple formats, such as ZIP and TAR.

I'm not a Python master, so this code may looks ugly to you â€” however it
works, at least for basic usage.

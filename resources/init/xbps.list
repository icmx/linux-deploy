# XBPS Packages List
#
# This file stores a list of Void Linux XBPS packages to be installed in
# system.
#
#                                    *  *  *
#
# You can process this file by following ways:
#
#   - Extract package names (one line, space separated):
#
#       cut -f 1 -d "#" xbps.list | tr -s "\n" " "
#
#   - Packages count:
#
#       [cut command above] | wc -w
#
#                                    *  *  *
#
# Most of package comments includes following plus-tags:
#
#   +noui  Package content has no any interface, it's probably some
#          resources like configuration or icons, or similar.
#
#          Alternatively, it may be a huge meta-package of software that
#          provides multiple user interfaces.
#
#   +cli   Package content has command-line, a single-shot interface for
#          terminals or their emulators (like "rxvt-unicode").
#
#   +tui   Package content has textual user interface which still runs
#          in terminal, but works interactively (mostly via arrow keys
#          i.e.)
#
#   +gui   Package content has full graphical user interface and thus
#          requires a graphical server.
#
#   +3rdp  Package is probably commented because it does not exist in
#          official repository. It should be installed manually from
#          third party sources.
#
#   +inap  Package is probably commented because of official repository
#          that provides inappropriate package (e.g. obsolete or too
#          bloated) content. It should be installed manually form third
#          party sources.

# Virtualization and Compatibility: Flatpak
#
#   Flatpak allows to run standalone applications in isolated
#   environments. It can be useful e.g. in case if you don't want to
#   install bunches of dependency packages just for one big application
#   (like in LibreOffice)

  flatpak                 # +cli

# Virtualization and Compatibility: Wine Windows-like Runtime
#
#   Wine provides compatible environment to run applications developed
#   for Microsoft® Windows® operating system. Most of simple 2D software
#   (e.g. graphical or text editors) works in Wine by itself, but for
#   advanced applications like 3D video games you'll probably need to
#   install additional components listed in section "Additional
#   Components: Libraries and Software External Modules (see for -32bit
#   entries).
#
#   Please note that there is only 32 bit version of Wine for Void
#   currently, so you can't run 64 bit Windows® software for now.

  wine-32bit              # +noui
  wine-gecko              # +noui
  wine-mono               # +noui
  winetricks              # +noui Script to configure Wine and install some components like Microsoft® DirectX®

# Virtualization and Compatibility: QEMU Emulator
#
#   Unlike Wine, QEMU is true emulator which able to run almost any
#   operating system including Unix-like, Microsoft® Windows®, Apple®
#   macOS® and some other.
#
#   QEMU does not provide any graphical interface by itself since it's a
#   command line application. Hovewer, you can use "virt-manager"
#   package to manage QEMU virtual machines via GUI.

  virt-manager            # +gui
  qemu                    # +cli
  qemu-ga                 # +noui

# One can't execute a single script sections separately e.g. as root and
# non-root user, so there should be a master script which will start
# multiple scripts for multiple users.
#
# Another way is root-only script which will change the attributes (such
# as owner and permissions) for different users, but I've found it too
# complicated after a while.
#
# One have to specify a user as 1st positional argumant to start master
# script correctly.
